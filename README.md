# MAGD
Each file is a previous assignment from my MAGD class, specifically the first 3 assignments.
## Assignment 1

This assignment was about turning basic shapes into something that resembles a cityscape or outerspace  
I chose to make it resemble a cityscape

## Assignment 2

This assignment was about using shapes to make something that resembles planets or balloons while also making use of colors.

I chose to make _balloons_ with varying **colors**.

## Assignment 3

This assignment was about making use of the mouse and pmouse variables  
I ended up not using one of the math functions due to wanting to turn in the assignment early when I should have pushed through and gone for full credit.
